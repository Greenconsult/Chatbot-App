Leveraging the use cases of generative artificial intelligence (AI), the chatbot application was built using OpenAIâ€™s advanced large language model (GPT-3.5 turbo), an embedding transformer model, and a vector database. Web technology and cloud solutions were introduced to make the chatbot application accessible to users anytime, anywhere via a web browser. Prompt engineering techniques were employed to enhance the chatbot's response abilities.

The performance of the chatbot was evaluated through user testing and various evaluation methods. Users expressed high satisfaction with the chatbot's performance. The results from this chatbot project demonstrated that the chatbot app outperformed the existing live chat platform of the university in terms of availability and response speed, showing its potential to reduce the workload of personnel on the University live chat platform, assist prospective and current students in swiftly accessing information about course programmes, modules, and other vital information about the University.
